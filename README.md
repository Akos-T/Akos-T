### Hello there 👋, 

My name is Akos and I'm a Senior Software Engineer who loves backend (Go) and frontend (React, Next.js) as well. 

- 📖 Looking to learn more about the infrastructure side of development (Kubernetes, Terraform, Pulumi, etc.)
- ✍️ I plan to write (from time to time) on [Medium](https://medium.com/@akos.codes)
- ⛓️ I'm also interested in the blockchain technology
- 🔬 Experimenting with [Encore](https://encore.dev) which is a backend development engine
