### Hello there 👋, 

My name is Akos and I'm a Senior Software Engineer who loves backend (Go) and frontend (React, Next.js) as well. 

- 🖥️ Working at [V_labs](https://www.vlabs.at) (with a different user: [@akosvlabs](https://github.com/akosvlabs))
- 📖 Looking to learn more about the infrastructure side of development (Kubernetes, Terraform, Pulumi, etc.)
- 💻 I have a website [akos.codes](https://akos.codes) which is currently under development
- ✍️ I plan to write (from time to time) on [Medium](https://medium.com/@akos.codes).
- ⛓️ I'm also interested in the blockchain technology
